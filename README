Personal website!

The idea I was going for was a old film player and tapes being the different subsections of the
website. However while using Three.js I was not going to create my own models as that is more
complex.

I downloaded the desk set up from 'sketchfab.com' with some free models, like the desk set up, is
under 'CC Attribution license'. The creator called 'Nyangire'. The

The original desk contained a monitor in the desk, I ended up removing it as it did not fit
with what I was going for. I wanted to delete it through inspecting its children and remove by
object name but that took to long as I could not find it. The final solution was just opening the
image in blender and deleting the can which if I am being honest I what I should of done in the
first case.

I downloaded the monitor it has now from 'sketchfab.com' with some free models, like the chair, is
under 'CC Attribution license'. The creator called 'Ethica' an artist based in North Carolina. The

I have been using blender a lot in order to get children name to apply my screens.

I wanted this project to take more of apple like aesthetic. I took a lot of inspiration from a
fellow developer, https://henryheffernan.com/ where his portfolio is truly amazing.
